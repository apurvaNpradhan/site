1. **Practice Smart**: Focus on understanding, not hours or question counts. Quality beats quantity.
2. **Stay Consistent**: It’s a marathon—small, regular efforts pay off over time.
3. **Use Pen and Paper**: Sketch your solution first. Test it with sample cases before coding.
4. **Know Complexity**: Check constraints—10⁵ means O(n log n), 10⁹ means O(log n). Pick the right approach.
5. **Learn from Others**: Even if you solve it, check other solutions for new tricks (e.g., O(n) with hashmaps).
6. **Track Your Wins**: Log problems, topics, and a one-line hint. It’s your cheat sheet for revision.

Grind smart, not just hard. Good luck!
